# COMP-6700
This is the project of COMP 6700 "Software Process"
This is all the programs I write during the study of "Software Process" class.
All the CA0 files are the project called "Count Star". And I also put the test cases in the file.
For the FA0 file are the sample test I try to test the new function I got.
